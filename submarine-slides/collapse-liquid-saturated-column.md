### Research questions
-   Is the behavior of saturated granular columns the same as the dry one or unsaturated one?    

 ### Future research / unanswered questions

-   Are scaling laws consistent with volume?
    
-   In a viscous regime, initial volume plays a significant role in the collapse (Rondon et al)
    
-   $d/l_c$ ($l_c$ is the capillary length defined as $\sqrt(\sigma/\rho_f g)$
	>potentially useful dimensionless unit for partially saturated media?
    
-   Can we find a centrifuge column collapse experiment?
    
-   New normalization based on volume using $St/g(\phi)$, where $g(\phi) = (1 - \phi)^-2.8$ then the $St$ is based on effective viscosity rather than fluid viscosity
    
### Main findings

-   Final run-out in fully saturated wet columns depend on the amount of liquid and Bond number, while the time and velocity scales remain unaffected and similar to dry conditions
    
-   Viscous dissipation decreases when St increases or volume fraction decreases (packing density decreases). 
    
-   When $St/g(\phi) < 1$, granular material is slowed down by the interstitial fluid due to viscous dissipation
    
-   Larger $St/g(\phi) > 1$, fluid may make it easier for the granular material to flow by pushing the grains in the direction of the flow (drag force facilitates the flow).
