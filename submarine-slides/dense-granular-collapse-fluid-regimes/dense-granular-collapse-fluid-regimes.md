### Research questions

-   Can we characterize the flow regimes of dense granular flows in fluid?
    

### Future research / unanswered questions

-   What is the role of initial volume on the run-out scaling?
    
-   The role of surrounding fluid in granular collapse, and more particularly the transition from viscous-dominated flow to a dry configuration remains uncertain.
    
-   Non-dimensional numbers $St$ and $r$ ignore the effect of packing and drag forces and assumes force is for a grain traveling vertically down.
    >   How can we use these scaling laws to test the effect of volume or packing fraction or permeability? (all these are ignored)
    >   Does Reynolds number sufficiently account for these aspects?
   
-   Descriptions of the regimes have been discussed in terms of the local dynamics of a single grain, its influence on the macroscopic flow, involving a granular material as the collapse, is then still uncertain.
    
-   Consider aspect ratio, $St$, $r$, $Re$, volume, packing density and permeability.
    
-   What is the effect of aspect ratio on $St$ and $r$ regime classification? 
    
-   How does the viscous, inertial, free-fall regimes dictate the run-out description? During the run-out is there a change in the regimes?
    
-   Redefine density ratio $r$ based on the Froudeâ€™s number or bulk density? Density ratio was approximated by assuming the drag coefficient is constant.
    
-   Propose a correlation between $St$, $r$ and $\zeta$ - the ratio of $U_{max}/U_{ff}$, considering the range of parameters of validity, this could only be achieved with numerical simulations.
  

### Methods/Materials

-   Deriving $St$ number, the authors assume the grains travel along the maximum slope angle, i.e., vertically which is not true.
    

### Main findings

-   Thompson and Huppert found that the surrounding fluid did not significantly influence the final runout and height compared to the dry case, even if transient dynamics were highlighting some differences. 
    
-   In submarine landslides density ratio $r \sim 1.$5, while $St$ ranges from 1E-1 to 1E6, where the flow belongs to the inertial or the viscous regime, depending strongly on the grain size, and the influence of the fluid should therefore be not disregarded. 
    
-   $St$ and $r$ are constant for a given set of fluid-grain properties and are therefore varied independently of the aspect ratio.
    > How does permeability affect this behavior?
    
-   The shape of the final deposit depends on both the aspect ratio and the considered regime. The final depository is more curved at the front (concave) for free-fall and Inertial regimes and is attributed to inertia in the dynamics of the granular fluid flow. 
    
-   Spreading length clearly increases with $St$, while the density ratio $r$ effects are marginal but it controls the flow front shape. This effect is more pronounced for aspect ratio $> 3$ and less pronounced for $a <= 2$. The runout length is significantly shorter in viscous and viscous inertial regimes than in free-fall and inertial regimes highlighting the $St$ dependence.
    
-   Free-fall, Inertial, visco-inertial, and viscous evolve at different rates, in that order (faster to slower).
    
-   Geophysical application, $St$ vary over several decades depending on the density and the size of the grains and influence the spreading length
    
-   Trigger time definition may be affected by the experiments but the ratio of trigger time to free-fall time is close to 3, not 1, for large values of St.
    
-   $T^- = min \left[(t_{95}-T_t)/T_{ff}, (t_{95}-T_t)/T_V, (t_{95} -T_t)/T_I\right]$ this tells which regime controls the flow
    
-   Reynolds number $Re_c = St_c/r_c \sim 2.5$
    
-   While the ratio of maximum velocity to free-fall velocity is clearly a function of $S_t$, it can also depend on density ratio $r$. 
    
-   When normalizing the center of gravity in $x$ and $y$, at this scale of observation, all results match the curve following a universal scaling, however, their final distances are different based on the aspect ratio and flow regimes. 
    
-   Geophysical parameterization of the simple process of fluid dissipation on the granular collapse. 
    
-   The authors observed curvature of the final profile and are intensified at large $St$ and are attributed to the inertia on the dynamics of the collapse.
