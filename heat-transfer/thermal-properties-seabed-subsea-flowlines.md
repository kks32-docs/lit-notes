### Learn:
-   step-out distance (Step out drilling programs have a fixed starting point from which they intend to expand the mineralization zone.)
-   ROV (remotely operated vehicles)
-   Transient shutdown times (With the increase of the shutdown time, the hot oil in the pipeline gradually turns into the cold oil.)    
-   Sloughing (shredding)    
-   Cooldown and warming times
   

### Research questions:

-   What soil parameters are ideal to bury the pipes?
    
-   Different burial methods affect soil thermal properties how should we account for this?
    
-   What quantities are used to evaluate the alternatives to the thermal insulation of deep flow pipelines?
> Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient

-   How deep should one bury a pipe? 
> -  Typically 4 D (diameter) of the pipe to get the best thermal properties based on the change in the gradient in the relationship between Overall Heat Thermal Coefficient (OHTC)
> - Typical burial depth in deep water is 4 feet. 
        
-   Does the water content go back to the original value after cutting and jetting backfill? What is the final value and how long does it take?
    >   Typically after a few months

-   Consolidation increases the strength of backfill, which increases the density - why does this inhibit the thermal convective currents?
    
-   How to measure the OHTC
 

#### Research questions (not important to answer heat-transfer paper)

-   What method should be used to bury the pipes?
-   How do they evaluate the feasibility of the pipe-in-pipe vs buried pipe method?
>   Cost comparison. PiP costs $300/ft to burial costs $185/ft.
-   Input properties are needed for modeling the thermal and structural properties of the flow lines
> Thermal conductivity, density, shear strength
    
  
### Research findings
#### Methods of burial:
-   In shallow water -> Tow and bury
-   Deepwater burial involves ROV-based jetting
-   “Talon” burial system can bury pipelines up to 24” (600 mm) in diameter typically to a depth of 4 feet (1.2m).
    
#### Properties of suitable backfill soil:
-   Provide soil insulation, i.e., prevent the tendencies for thermal convection
-   Upheaval buckling  
-   Prevent the floating of a flowline with low specific gravity.
    

Cutting and jetting increase the water content of the soil reducing Su and affecting the thermal properties of the clay.

The backfilling process irrespective of the method weakens the clay. Cutting and jetting increase the water content thereby reducing the strength. Alternatively, mechanical plowing to backfill creates weak soil lumps. All these methods of backfilling reduce strength. With time consolidation happens due to the positive charge in saltwater leading to the negatively charged clay particles to flocculate and settle. 

Backfill represents soil with low values of thermal conductivity, increased strength and density inhibits thermal convective currents.

#### Thermal properties of the buried pipeline is affected by: 
-   Soil thermal properties
-   The thickness of the pipe and depth of burial
-   Inlet temperature / pressure
-   Flowline size
-   Thermal properties of the coating
    
Thermal conductivity is the amount of heat passing through a unit cross-section area under a unit thermal gradient in unit time. Measured in W/m-K. The thermal conductivity of seabed soils is variable and requires investigation. 

#### Soil properties in the Gulf of Mexico 
-   Properties depend on sedimentation history. The Gulf of Mexico is made of pelagic or hemipelagic clays with a sensitivity of 3 - 4.
-   GoM is made of Underconsolidated weak soils that have a strength of 1.2 - 1.7 kPa and a moisture content of > 150%  (In comparison, Stronger clays have a strength of 3.6 kPa. For OC clays have a strength of 50 kPa. )
-   Exhibits low permeability that make them strongly resistant to thermal convection
-   Saturated soils have high moisture content which exhibits low values of thermal conductivity
-   K of 0.6 W/m-K at shallow (< 10ft or 3m) at high water content. 
-   Intact soils vary between 0.8 at a water content of 240% to 1.1 W/m-K at 60% moisture content. 

**Thermal conductivity seems to be influenced by moisture content rather than clay mineralogy**. Thermal conductivity values observed in this study are lower than previously considered. 

Powers reported K of 0.9 - 1.4 W/m-K for the water content of 25 - 60% from in-situ ROV in the North Sea.

Overall Heat Thermal Coefficient (OHTC) for the buried pipeline is 1.82 W/m^2-K compared to 1.19 W/m^2-K for pipe-in-pipe construction.
